# push_swap
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

for program: make
```
$>ARG="2 1 0 ..."; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker_OS $ARG
Result should OK
./push_swap 2 3 5 1 | wc -l
Result: 4
```

```
$>ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | wc -l
6
$>ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
OK
$>
```

```
- sa :swap 'a' - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack 'a';
- sb :swap 'b' - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack 'b';
- ss :sa and sb at the same time.
- pa :push 'a' - take the first element at the top of 'b' and put it at the top of 'a'.
- pb :push 'b' - take the first element at the top of 'a' and put it at the top of 'b'.
- ra :rotate 'a' - shift up all elements of stack 'a' by 1.
- rb :rotate 'b' - shift up all elements of stack 'b' by 1.
- rr :ra and rb at the same time.
- rra :reverse rotate 'a' - shift down all elements of stack 'a' by 1.
- rrb :reverse rotate 'b' - shift down all elements of stack 'b' by 1;
- rrr :rra and rrb at the same time.
