# push_swap
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

for program: make
```
$>ARG="2 1 0 ..."; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker_OS $ARG
Result should OK
./push_swap 2 3 5 1 | wc -l
Result: 4
```

```
$>ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | wc -l
6
$>ARG="4 67 3 87 23"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
OK
$>
```

```
- sa :swap 'a' - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack 'a';
- sb :swap 'b' - swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack 'b';
- ss :sa and sb at the same time.
- pa :push 'a' - take the first element at the top of 'b' and put it at the top of 'a'.
- pb :push 'b' - take the first element at the top of 'a' and put it at the top of 'b'.
- ra :rotate 'a' - shift up all elements of stack 'a' by 1.
- rb :rotate 'b' - shift up all elements of stack 'b' by 1.
- rr :ra and rb at the same time.
- rra :reverse rotate 'a' - shift down all elements of stack 'a' by 1.
- rrb :reverse rotate 'b' - shift down all elements of stack 'b' by 1;
- rrr :rra and rrb at the same time.
```
